Challenge Page: [Some Assembly Required 2](http://mercury.picoctf.net:21939/)

## Walkthrough
Similar to Some Assembly required 1 there was a weird line where the flag was supposed to be. So i put that line in an online decrypter and i got the flag.

## Flag
`picoCTF{6b247e06e36c9984b7500db8d992f3fe}`
